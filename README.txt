Real-time Stereo Matching using Adaptive Binary Window
------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this project is to provide an implementation for generating depth maps in real-time, as outlined in this paper:

http://diglib.eg.org/EG/DL/PE/3DPVT/3DPVT2010Papers/03_paper018.pdf

Parts of OpenCV 2.4.8 are currently used for image file I/O. They are pre-built (x64, vc12).

The end result should output depth maps of acceptable quality, in real-time, from data aquired by a pair of consumer-grade USB cameras.

The Visual Studio files are compatible with Visual Studio 2013.
